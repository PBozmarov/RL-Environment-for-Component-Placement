            Printed circuit boards (PCBs) are
            the core foundation which supports the majority
            of electronic products produced in the economy.
            Due to the rapid progress in artificial intelligence,
            there has been significant potential for remarkable advances
            in computer systems and hardware. While the PCB industry has advanced
            significantly over the decades by decreasing the size while simultaneously
            increasing speed and capabilities of electronic components, the design cycle
            for manufacturing PCB's has achieved minimal development and optimization.
            Despite decades of research on this problem, the current industry
            procedures still require human experts to manually modify PCB's using placement
            tools inorder to produce solutions that meet the multi-faceted design criterion's.
            In this project, we apply a learning based approach, by training a reinforcement learning agent
            to optimize the component placement task in a grid environment.
