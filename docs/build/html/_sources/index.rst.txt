RL-PCB Documentation
================================

This repository provides gym-compatible environments to model the problem of component placement on printed circuit boards (PCBs). The repository also provides tools to train reinforcement learning (RL) agents using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) on these environments. The codebase for the reinforcement learning algorithms is based on Tensorflow and RLlib.

Additional information about the problem of component placement on PCBs is provided in the  :doc:`about` section. The sections :doc:`installation`, :doc:`usage` and :doc:`api` describe the usage of the repository.
